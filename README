NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqsMatching - A more flexible prereq
    remover

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqsMatching - released June 18, 2012 as
    part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-RemovePrereqsMatching.

SYNOPSIS
        ; in your dist.ini
        [RemovePrereqsMatching]
        remove_matching = ^Template::Whatever::.*$
        remove_matching = ^Dist::Zilla.*$

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin builds on Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqs to allow
    prerequisites to be removed by regular expression, rather than string
    equality. This can be useful when you have a "DPAN" package consisting
    of a bunch of modules under a common namespace, whose installation can
    be handled by one common prerequisite specification.

METHODS
  register_prereqs
    We implement this method to scan the list of prerequisites assembled to
    date, and remove any tat match any of the expressions given to us.

OPTIONS
  remove_matching
    This option defines a regular expression that will be used to test
    prerequisites for removal. We may be specified multiple times to define
    multiple expressions to test prerequisites against; a prerequisite needs
    to match at least one expression to be excluded.

SEE ALSO
    Please see those modules/websites for more information related to this
    module.
